## Features

The main goal of **Fitness Journey** is to allow an athlete to create workout routines using exercises contained on the website's exercise database.

**Fitness Journey** contains a database with a variety of exercises. Each exercise contains information: exercise description, equipment utilized, muscles worked, instructions, and a picture showing how to perform the exercise. This allows users to really understand the exercise.

Users will be able to share their fitness knowledge with others via post/comment system. This allows users to communicate with other members of the application, as well as grow their knowledge of fitness with one another by sharing information with one another.
